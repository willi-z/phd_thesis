abstract = {Several studies have shown the importance of carbon fibres (CF) for different high technology markets. In recent years, different fibre types with improved properties have been developed for those markets. Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) copolymers are the basic raw material (precursor) for these fibres in the predominant case. Improvements of the mechanical fibre properties have mainly been achieved by defect reduction during the manufacturing process. Thus, commercial carbon fibres with tensile strengths up to approx. 7000 MPa are currently available. It can be shown that the strengths can be further increased (in the direction of graphene properties) when the relationship between process conditions and defects due to manufacturing of the fibres is better understood. In this context, novel processes like electron beam crosslinking or UV-activation have proven to be very promising. The article gives an overview about the current situation in the field of carbon fibres development and particularly shows recent shortcomings with respect to novel applications.},

abstract = {Active fibre-reinforced thermoplastic composites offer a high application potential for lightweight structures capable for series production. By the integration of functional components like material-embedded piezoceramic actuators or sensors the structural behaviour becomes actively controllable and manipulable. Currently, a wide application of such adaptive structures is mainly restricted by the lack of robust manufacture technologies. Therefore, these investigations are performed to develop and realise a novel robust and efficient manufacture process capable for series production. This process bases on a material and actuator adapted hot pressing technique. In this context, special regard is given to the sub process e-preforming. There a thermoplastic film is assembled with thermoplastic compatible piezoceramic modules and the necessary conductive paths. By the development of a special e-preforming unit and the corresponding parameter investigations an adapted manufacture of so called e-preforms can be realised.}

abstract = {For a reliable design of components made of textile composites, a deep knowledge of their failure behaviour and of realistic damage models is necessary. Such models require the onset of damage and the evolution of different damage phenomena to be determined experimentally. In this context, an experimental damage analysis strategy is proposed here that combines crack density measurements, acoustic emission analysis and optical microscopy with the recording of stiffness degradation by ultrasonic wave speed measurements. The correlation between the results of quasi-static tests is discussed for two selected examples of textile composites: multi-layered flat bed weft-knitted glass fibre–epoxy composites and woven glass fibre–polypropylene composites made of hybrid fabrics.}

abstract = {The so called in situ computed tomography is a powerful non-destructive testing method to study the damage phenomenology while a material is loaded. However, the difference in the detected amount of damage compared to conventional CT scans after unloading of the specimen has not been reported so far and is therefore the focus of this study. Three different textile-reinforced composite materials have been experimentally investigated for that purpose. Carbon fibre reinforced epoxy composites with multi-layered flat bed weft-knitted fabrics and multi-axial non-crimp fabrics were uniaxially loaded in tension. In situ CT scans were taken at different load levels and conventional CT scans after unloading. The experiments have shown that the observed crack lengths and delaminated areas are significantly larger while the load is applied because of crack closure effects during unloading. Any damage diagnosis should therefore be performed under load. A ceramic C/C composite with woven reinforcement was taken as a third example. This composite was loaded by compression in thickness direction. It was found that the decrease of total porosity with increasing load can only be predicted by in situ CT measurements.}

ABSTRACT = {The impact behavior of carbon fiber epoxy bumper brackets reinforced with 2D biaxial and 2D triaxial braids was experimentally and numerically analyzed. For this purpose, a phenomenological damage model was modified and implemented as a user material in ABAQUS. It was hypothesized that all input parameters could be determined from a suitable high-speed test program. Therefore, novel impact test device was designed, developed and integrated into a drop tower. Drop tower tests with different impactor masses and impact velocities at different bumper bracket configurations were conducted to compare the numerically predicted deformation and damage behavior with experimental evidence. Good correlations between simulations and tests were found, both for the global structural deformation, including fracture, and local damage entities in the impact zone. It was proven that the developed phenomenological damage models can be fully applied for present-day industrial problems.},
